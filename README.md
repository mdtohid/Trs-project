## how I made this site:

- First I searched in google to look for relevant sites I had in my mind
- I installed all necessary packages to begin with then I started designing navbar and banner.
- Then I started authentication and made login and register components and made connection between server.
- Made connection in all the other to server and implemented them one by one.
- I always checked if the components I am making are responsive in design and theme.
- After uploading my server site to vercel I checked if everything is working properly or not.
- Then I deployed my site to Firebase and checked everything again and fixed issues that were occurring.
